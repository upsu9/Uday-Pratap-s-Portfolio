        <p class="sec2 container container-center" style="color:var(--primary-color)"> Hi! My name is Uday Pratap Singh.
            My birthplace is Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. In my childhood, I always used to wonder whenever I play games on
            computer that How those animations and every step of GTA works just after clicking a button. If I recall
            those memories then I find that yahoo.com used to be a very popular website those days. Fast forward to my
            graduation days, I moved to Agra and joined a Reputed college. I was quite sure that I would be getting
            Mechanical or CS but end up getting Civil branch but my interest for CS still there. I had average score in
            graduation and was placed in a renewable energy firm as a GET in 2017. After joining the company, I worked
            day and night just to get the knowledge and to give 100% effort to organization but I still used to look for
            opportunity to get into IT sector. In December 2020, I had gotten idea about Neog but I was not sure that I
            could go with this plan or not. I used to watch Tanay’s video a lot. It gave me so much motivation courage
            that atleast I could give a try.

            If I tell about my current situation than I got a job in some IT start-up and it became possible due to
            Level Zero portfolio. I am looking forward to learn many more thing in level one.
            That’s it for now.
            . </P>
