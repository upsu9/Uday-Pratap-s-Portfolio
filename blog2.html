        <p style="color:var(--primary-color)"> As i see, from last 5 years per unit cost for solar generation unit value has been decreased drastilcally. This is all happening because of competiotion in the market. Big companies are awarded big projects but ultimately they transfer entire load on small EPCs and contractors. EPC and contractors have to work on very less margin and time which indirectly affects the quality of projects. Metal and solar cells are already on high selling price.Indirectly,it is affecting normal labour and clients. labours are getting very less salary as per their skills. clients or customers's project quality is compromised. If Government is not going to amend in some tax and duties than in coming years there will be no EPCs or contractors as they will plan to transfer their bussiness into other field.</p>

        <p style="color:var(--primary-color)"> Nowadays, Many farmers are coming forward to get installed solar panels in their fields and there is also very high demand for solar pumps. Many state governments are providing subsidy and relaxation to farmers. But farmers are also facing hurdles like. panels are getting damaged or stolen by local goons and thieves. Hence, Portable solar system should be developed and used in our urban areas to overcome this issue.
